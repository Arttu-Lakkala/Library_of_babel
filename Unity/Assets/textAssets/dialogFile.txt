“Those who come to the library, do so in search of a form that will reveal itself to the correct eye. I arrived here when I was young, but now can barely make out a word.”$”Yet, every step inscribes a body in space and the library is a palimpsest covered with dust motes, tired floors and misaligned spines.”$”Some searched for a cure. Some for the lost. Others for the future or something buried in the past. Everyone ends up here in the end.”@"Some searched for a cure. Some for the lost.

@“The library exists <i>ab aeterno</i>. At least, that’s what the mystics contend. Certainly, in this infinity of rooms and texts are contained every permutation of letters.”$“It is said that there must exist a codex of codices. And another and another, more or less perfect.”$“The library’s structure is vast, perhaps unknowable. But I am not a linguist or a cartographer. My research is narrow, even if now far from its beginning.”
@“I once knew a man called Nachash. He lived during a time when the entire world spoke one language. When that dream died, he went into the mountains.”$”One day he will emerge among these stacks.”$”Quand je le connassais, ll portait un étoile rouge et avait la sensibilité à fleur de peau.”
@“What? Oh? Ohohoho! It was just a dream? O-ho! I wouldn’t be much of a botanist if I couldn’t tell the difference between a lotus and a rose!”$“Are you sure, youngster? You look so thin… No one that anyone I meet is ever hungry.”$“Where was I? It must be here somewhere? Oh yes, the lotus formosissimus can be identified by its small yellow and white flowers…”$[She mutters to herself]“…often grows in coastal seeps. Ohoho!“$“Now, where was I? It was all just a dream?”
@"Mistelilääke on tullut tunnetuksi nimenomaan syöpälääkkeenä. Viimeaikaiset tutkimukset ovat osoittaneet, etteivät väitteet mistelimehun syöpää ehkäisevistä ominaisuuksista ole huhua."
@“The library is often said to possess a universal structure, although much dispute has arisen over this claim.”$“Fanatics, living many levels above this one, profess to have gained access to a vision of its centre.”$“At this point, they state, lies a singular and universal word. A monad from which all comprehension derives.”$“Another sect, whose teachings are frequently dismissed as heretical, argue that differentiation through entropy determines the library’s form.”$“According to their measurements, it is possible that we merely lie in a zone of mutual comprehension.”$“If that were the case, who knows what forms of life exist at the outer limits of these repetitious chambers?”
@Something burrows within this wood. <i>Microzymas de feuilles</i>. The bark untouched, it penetrates through layers. Burrowing to an endless centre.”$”Is it in me too? These letters, pitch and regular; so different from those formed by my own hand make me feel ashamed.”
@“There is nowhere to hide. He saw everything.”$“The cells are arranged in a circular formation and he stands in their centre.”

@Upon the librarian opening its mouth, the chirping stops.

@The librarian opens its mouth. A sound like horn of a train fills the room.
@The librarian makes the sound of shuffled papers.
@The librarian quacks mockingly.
@Pulses of electronic noise spatter from the librarian’s hands.
@"Librarian? Can you help me, please? I’m looking for a cure. Some kind of sleeping sickness. I think… Even now it takes hold of them!"$"I came here to help! But I realise that I do not even know the way out… I think this is the <i>end</i>!"
